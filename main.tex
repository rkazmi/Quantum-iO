\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
An \emph{indistiguishability obfuscator} takes as input a circuit %C$ 
and outputs a new circuit, %$C'$, 
such that for any two circuits that compute the  \emph{same} function, the ouputs of the indistinguishability obfuscator are 
%$C'_1$ and $C'_2$ are
 computationally indistinguishable. Here, we initiate the study of feasibility for indistinguishability obfuscation for \emph{quantum} circuits. We construct an indistinguishability  obfuscator that takes as input a quantum circuit, and outputs a quantum state and a quantum circuit, which together can be used to evaluate the original quantum circuit, on any quantum input; the security guarantee being that for two quantum circuits that have the same input-output behaviour, the outputs of the obfuscator are indistinguishable. In our construction, the size of the output of the obfuscator is exponential in the number of non-Clifford gates, which means that the construction is efficient as long as the number of non-Clifford gates is logarithmic. \anote{Need to update prior text, based on final results. }
